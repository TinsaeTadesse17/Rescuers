	<h1>How to get into proper mental state</h1> 
	<p>GENDER-BASED VIIOLENCE is an umbrella term for any harmful act that is perpetrated against a person’s will
and that is based on socially ascribed (i.e. gender) differences between males and females. It includes acts that
inflict physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering, threats of such acts, coercion, and other deprivations of liberty.
These acts can occur in public or in private.<br>
GENDER refers to the social differences between males and females that are learned. Though deeply rooted in
every culture, social differences are changeable over time, and have wide variations both within and between
cultures. “Gender” determines the roles, responsibilities, opportunities, privileges, expectations, and limitations
for males and for females in any culture.<br> Allow the survivor to express their emotions in whatever form they
are – some people are quiet, others are angry and yelling, others
may be crying and so on. Listen to the survivor and ask how you can
help. Do not ask questions about what happened or the details of the
incident, instead emphasize that you are there to be a listening ear
to whatever the survivor wants to share.
<br>Recognize if you find yourself in a situation that is not safe for the
survivor or yourself. There may be other focal points with the capacity
to better support in this scenario.<br>Note to facilitator: introduce PSEA protocols and other relevant procedures in your context, including limits to confidentiality, information
sharing/reporting requirements and considerations for children.
<br>REMEMBER, if you want to seek support from a supervisor or another
humanitarian actor, ALWAYS ask permission from the survivor first
including sharing who you want to talk to, why you want to talk to
them and what information you would share. If the survivor is not
comfortable or outright refuses sharing of their information, help them
using the tools in the Pocket Guide.
<br>As humanitarians, our duty is to respect and protect the rights
and needs of all persons in need, and to not make assumptions</p>
