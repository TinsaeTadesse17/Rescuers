	<h1>Steps for Implementing care to a GBV victim</h1> 

 
<p>GENDER-BASED VIIOLENCE is an umbrella term for any harmful act that is perpetrated against a person’s will
and that is based on socially ascribed (i.e. gender) differences between males and females. It includes acts that
inflict physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering, threats of such acts, coercion, and other deprivations of liberty.
These acts can occur in public or in private.<br>
GENDER refers to the social differences between males and females that are learned. Though deeply rooted in
every culture, social differences are changeable over time, and have wide variations both within and between
cultures. “Gender” determines the roles, responsibilities, opportunities, privileges, expectations, and limitations
for males and for females in any culture.

KEY MESSAGES  
4 Always talk to a GBV or child  
protection specialist in your country/ 
context first to understand: (1) what  
services are available in your area and  
(2) local protocols and procedures.4  
4 Do not harm. Do not seek out  
child survivors. It is not your job  
to investigate or assess if a child/ 
adolescent is experiencing violence.  
Doing so can lead to more violence  
and risks for the child/adolescent.  
Be approachable if a child/adoles- 
cent wants to seek your help. 
4 Remember your role. If a child/ 
adolescent reaches out to you for help,  
1. Provide a listening ear, free of  
judgment.  
2. Support the child/adolescent by  
connecting them to an adult that
the child/adolescent identifies as  
being safe and trusted. This may  
not be their parent, caregiver or a  
family member.  
3. Do not make decisions for him/ 
her, including forcing the child/ 
adolescent’s caregiver or any  
other person to be with them  
when s/he talks to you.  
4 Provide comfort. Allow the  
child/adolescent to lead the  
conversation, even if this means  
providing company in silence. Be at  
eye level with open body language  
to show the child/adolescent that  
they can open up to you if s/he  
wants to. Refrain from asking  
questions about what happened,  
by who and why – instead use  
comforting statements and speak in  
a manner that they can understand.
Treat every child fairly.
Maintain confidentiality.</p>
