    <p>GENDER-BASED VIIOLENCE is an umbrella term for any harmful act that is perpetrated against a person’s will
and that is based on socially ascribed (i.e. gender) differences between males and females. It includes acts that
inflict physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering, threats of such acts, coercion, and other deprivations of liberty.
These acts can occur in public or in private.<br>
GENDER refers to the social differences between males and females that are learned. Though deeply rooted in
every culture, social differences are changeable over time, and have wide variations both within and between
cultures. “Gender” determines the roles, responsibilities, opportunities, privileges, expectations, and limitations
for males and for females in any culture.<br>
Always reach out to a GBV specialist to
understand what services are available in
your area. While a GBV actor, including a
referral pathway or a GBV focal point, may
not be available in your area, there are
other services that may be helpful and
supportive to a survivor and their needs.
Humanitarian actors are responsible for
having up to date information on available
services and supports in the communities in
which they work. It is critical to know what
services are available – including at the
community level. Work within your agency
and team, or cluster, to identify focal points
(such as health, mental health/psychosocial
support and protection actors) that can provide
information on available services.
